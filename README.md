# Biophotonics
This code is a crucial part of image processing in Dr. Berns Lab of Institute of Engineering in Medicine of UC San Diego.

The purpose of our study is to analyze the calcium response on the cellular response of brain cells to the death of the surrounding cells.

We first use ImageJ to process row images of neurons from microscopes to data table (csv). Then apply this program in MATLAB to analyze the data and to get:

1.normalized data for each ROI (neuron)

2.Peaks and Half-life for each ROI after each stimulation (death of surrounding cell or adding drug)
